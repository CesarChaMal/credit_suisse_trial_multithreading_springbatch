Dependency Inversion Principle (Dependency Injection and Strategy for example used in CalculatorEngineManager class)


#Trial Description

In the financial world we're operating on a term "financial instrument". You can think of it as of a collection of prices of currencies, commodities, derivatives, etc.

For the purpose of this exercise we provide you an input file with multiple time series containing prices of instruments:

-	INSTRUMENT1

-	INSTRUMENT2

-	INSTRUMENT3

File format is as follows:

<INSTRUMENT_NAME>,<DATE>,<VALUE>

For instance:


INSTRUMENT1,12-Mar-2015,12.21

TASK:

Read time series from the file provided and pass all of them to the "calculation module".

Calculation engine needs to calculate:

For INSTRUMENT1 � mean

For INSTRUMENT2 � mean for November 2014

For INSTRUMENT3 � any other statistical calculation that we can compute "on-the-fly" as we read the file (it's up to you)

For any other instrument from the input file - sum of the newest 10 elements


Now, we want to emulate the fact that in the real life there are often multiple factors influencing calculations performed on the 
instrument prices. 

So as part of your task we would like you to set up a database with only one table, called INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER with the 
following columns:


ID (primary key)
NAME (instrument name as read from the input file)
MULTIPLIER - double value that specifies the factor by which the original instrument price should be multiplied.

So in order to determine the final value of a given instrument price for a given date you should do the following:

1. read the line from the input file;

2. query the database to see if there is an entry for the <INSTRUMENT_NAME> you read in the 1st step;

3. if there is - multiply the original <VALUE> by the factor you found in the step 2;

4. if there is no entry - simply use the original <VALUE> from the file.


Please assume that the values in the INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER table can change frequently independently of the process you're implementing, but not more often than once every 5 seconds.


What needs to be done:

-	Create the maven project.

-	Model the problem using OO principles.

-	Test the solution.

-	Send the source code back to us (don't include any executables or jars !)

Remember:

-	Input data is most likely not sorted.

-	We can assume that current date is 19-Dec-2014 � so we�re not expecting any data after that date.

-	Bear in mind that your solution should also work for a file that has many gigabytes of data (with 10k 	instruments instead of 3); your solution should be capable of handling that much of data !

-   Assume it's vitally important to calculate the above mentioned metrics as quickly as possible; your solution 	should scale 
	effectively 

-	Validate the date - it should be a business date, i.e. Monday � Friday.

- 	Provide a quick description of your solution: how to run and test it, plus some info about important design 	decisions, profiling you performed etc. 


Technical requirements:

-	Use any JVM version you feel most comfortable with and not older than 1.6 :-)

-	You�re allowed to use Open Source libraries and frameworks of your choice, so you�re free to use Mockito, 	JUnit, Guava, Apache Commons, Spring etc.

    But please - do not try to show off and don't 'over engineere'; your solution won't be evaluated on the basis of the number 
	of frameworks used but rather on the beauty of your design and the efficiency of the algorithms used.  

- 	please use an Open Source and lightweight database (e.g. h2, Derby), memory or file-based - your choice, that 	doesn't require installation of any prerequisite softare and can be launched 

	and torn down as part of your implementation via maven.

-	We must be able to build and run your program simply by using Maven; in particular:

        * we won't be able to evaluate your solution if it does depend on proprietary libraries we don't have licences for; 

	* if you plan to use some external servers on which you'd like to host your application, then those servers must be 
	launched and stopped as part of your implementation; you can't expect us to set up the environment externally;


Hints: 


-   when we say that your solution should be able to process gigabytes of data - we really mean it :-); think about 	some ways of making sure that you won't end up getting OutOfMemory errors any time you'll try to process a huge 	input file;	


ABOVE SPECIFICATION IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE USED FOR CANDIDATE SKILLS EVALUATION ONLY.
