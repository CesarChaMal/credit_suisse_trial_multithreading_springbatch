# Credit Suisse Trial to get a job in Poland

## 1. Technologies Used
* Maven 3.0
* Spring-Boot 1.4.0.RELEASE
* Spring-Batch 1.4.0.RELEASE
* Spring-JPA 1.4.0.RELEASE

## 2. To Run This Project Locally
```shell
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 3. Configuration (app.properties)

### Calculation Engine Settings
- **Manager_Startup**: `true` - To activate or deactivate calculation engine
- **RefreshMillis**: `3600000` - Time in milliseconds for the calculation engine to compute instrument prices
- **MaxThreads**: `1` - Number of threads for the calculation engine

### Price Modifier Worker Settings
- **Worker_Startup**: `true` - To activate or deactivate the price modifier worker
- **SleepMillis**: `5000` - Time in milliseconds for the price modifier worker to update prices
- **ThreadPoolSize**: `10` - Number of threads for the workers
- **WorkerProfile**: `Instrument-2` - Name for the worker

### File and Data Settings
- **InputFile**: `input.txt` - Name for the input file of the instruments
- **Instruments_Count**: `10` - Max number of instruments allowed
- **Newest**: `10` - Max number of latest instruments to sum (only for instrument type 3)

### Modifier Settings
- **Modifiers**: `true` - To activate or deactivate modifiers
- **Modifier_Min**: `1` - Initial range of the modifiers generated for the price modifier worker
- **Modifier_Max**: `10` - Final range of the modifiers generated for the price modifier worker
- **Modifier_Double**: `true` - Enable random doubles, otherwise generate random integers

## 4. Test Case Generation
Use this class to generate test cases:
```
com.credit_suisse.app.execs.InstrumentFileGenerator
```

## 5. Design Patterns Used
- Static Factory
- Singleton
- Strategy
- Builder
- Dependency Injection
- DAO
- DTO
- Iterator
- Decorator
- Command

## 6. OOP Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: All classes follow this principle (e.g., TaskManager class)
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Static Factory added for CalculatorEngine to not violate this principle
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Decorator, Strategy, Composite patterns used for the Instrument class
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Applied in calculation module classes
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Dependency Injection and Strategy patterns used in CalculatorEngineManager class

## Trial Description

In the financial world we're operating on a term "financial instrument". You can think of it as of a collection of prices of currencies, commodities, derivatives, etc.

For the purpose of this exercise we provide you an input file with multiple time series containing prices of instruments:

- INSTRUMENT1
- INSTRUMENT2
- INSTRUMENT3

### File Format
```
<INSTRUMENT_NAME>,<DATE>,<VALUE>
```

**Example:**
```
INSTRUMENT1,12-Mar-2015,12.21
```

## Task

Read time series from the file provided and pass all of them to the "calculation module".

### Calculation Requirements
- **INSTRUMENT1**: Calculate mean
- **INSTRUMENT2**: Calculate mean for November 2014
- **INSTRUMENT3**: Any other statistical calculation that can be computed "on-the-fly" as we read the file
- **Any other instrument**: Sum of the newest 10 elements

## Database Setup

To emulate real-life factors influencing calculations, set up a database with one table called `INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER`:

### Table Structure
- **ID**: Primary key
- **NAME**: Instrument name as read from the input file
- **MULTIPLIER**: Double value specifying the factor by which the original instrument price should be multiplied

### Price Calculation Process
1. Read the line from the input file
2. Query the database for an entry matching the `<INSTRUMENT_NAME>`
3. If entry exists: multiply the original `<VALUE>` by the factor from step 2
4. If no entry exists: use the original `<VALUE>` from the file

**Note**: Values in the `INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER` table can change frequently but not more often than once every 5 seconds.

## Requirements

- Create the Maven project
- Model the problem using OO principles
- Test the solution
- Send the source code back (don't include any executables or jars!)

## Important Considerations

- Input data is most likely **not sorted**
- Current date is **19-Dec-2014** - no data expected after this date
- Solution must handle **gigabytes of data** (10k+ instruments)
- **Performance is critical** - calculate metrics as quickly as possible
- **Date validation** - must be a business date (Monday-Friday)
- Provide description of solution: how to run, test, design decisions, profiling, etc.

## Technical Requirements

### JVM and Libraries
- Use any JVM version 1.6 or newer
- Open Source libraries allowed: Mockito, JUnit, Guava, Apache Commons, Spring, etc.
- **Don't over-engineer** - focus on design beauty and algorithm efficiency

### Database
- Use lightweight Open Source database (H2, Derby)
- Memory or file-based
- No prerequisite software installation required
- Must be launched and torn down via Maven

### Build and Deployment
- Must build and run with Maven only
- No proprietary libraries
- Any external servers must be launched/stopped as part of implementation

## Hints

- **Memory Management**: When processing gigabytes of data, ensure you won't get OutOfMemory errors with huge input files
